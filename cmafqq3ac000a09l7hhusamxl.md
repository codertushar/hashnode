## 1\. How Does the Browser Render a Webpage?

The **Critical Rendering Path**:

1. HTML is parsed into a **DOM**
    
2. CSS is parsed into a **CSSOM**
    
3. **Render Tree** = DOM + CSSOM
    
4. Layout: computes geometry
    
5. Paint: pixels drawn
    
6. Compositing: layers combined
    

> Optimize this path by deferring non-critical resources and minimizing blocking scripts.

## 2\. What Is Event Delegation?

Instead of attaching listeners to many child elements, we attach one listener to a common parent and use [`event.target`](http://event.target) to determine the source.

**Why it's powerful:**

* Works for dynamic content
    
* Fewer listeners = better performance
    

---

## 3\. How Does React’s Reconciliation Work?

React builds a new **virtual DOM tree** on every state/prop update, then diffs it with the previous one.

* Only the **minimal required DOM mutations** are applied
    
* `key` props are crucial for efficient list diffs
    

---

## 4\. Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components in React

* **Controlled**: React state owns the input (`value`, `onChange`)
    
* **Uncontrolled**: DOM manages the state (`ref` access)
    

> Controlled components offer better control and testability — ideal for validations and conditionals.

---

## 5\. How Do You Handle Async Data in React?

Typical pattern:

* Use `useEffect` to trigger fetch
    
* Maintain states: `loading`, `error`, `data`
    
* Avoid memory leaks via abort signals or `isMounted` checks
    
* Consider `React Query` for caching, retries, and background updates
    

---

## 6\. `==` vs `===` in JavaScript

* `==` performs **type coercion** (e.g., `"5" == 5` → true)
    
* `===` is **strict** (no coercion)
    

> Use `===` by default to avoid bugs.

---

## 7\. What Is a Closure?

A closure is a function that remembers variables from its **lexical scope**, even after that scope has exited.

```js
function counter() {
  let count = 0;
  return () => ++count;
}
const inc = counter();
inc(); // 1
```

> Used in debouncing, memoization, and encapsulating private state.

---

## 8\. What Causes React Re-renders?

* State or props change
    
* Context update
    

**Avoid unnecessary renders with:**

* `React.memo`
    
* `useMemo`, `useCallback`
    
* Guarding against setting identical state
    

---

## 9\. How Do You Optimize Frontend Performance?

* Lazy-load images & components
    
* Code-split using `React.lazy` or `import()`
    
* Use CDN for static assets
    
* Minify + compress JS/CSS
    
* Memoize expensive computations
    

---

## 10\. What Are Common Frontend Security Concerns?

* **XSS**: escape HTML, use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` sparingly
    
* **CSRF**: use `SameSite` cookies, CSRF tokens
    
* Avoid exposing secrets in client code
    
* Always validate inputs both client and server-side
    

---

## 11\. Best Practices for API Integration in React

* Use `fetch` or Axios with async/await
    
* Model `loading`, `error`, `data` explicitly
    
* Use HTTP status codes meaningfully
    
* Handle pagination, retries, token expiry
    

---

## 12\. How Does `useEffect` Work with Dependencies?

* Triggers when any dependency changes
    
* **Common mistakes**:
    
    * Omitting deps → stale values
        
    * Including unstable functions → infinite loops
        

> Use `useCallback` or `useRef` to stabilize dependencies when needed.

---

## 13\. Can You Write a Debounce Function?

Yes. Used to throttle rapid events like keystrokes or window resize:

```js
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}
```

## Final Thoughts

In under 35 minutes, these questions let you gauge:

* JavaScript depth
    
* React fluency
    
* Async thinking
    
* Performance awareness
    
* Real-world readiness
    

Even backend-heavy candidates should be able to reason through most of these. If they can’t — they're not ready to ship modern web UIs. If they can — you’ve got a true full-stack asset.
